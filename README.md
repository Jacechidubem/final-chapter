## About Me

My name is Joseph Enyinnia, a MERN Stack trainee at GOMYCODE. Throughout this bootcamp, I have developed strong technical and professional skills that have prepared me to take the next step in my software development career.

## Readiness for the Next Step in My Career

I consider myself ready to move forward as I transition into professional opportunities such as internships, junior developer roles, or freelance work. During the program:

- I gained hands-on experience building full-stack applications.

- I learned how to work with modern technologies and follow best practices.

These experiences have equipped me with the confidence and competence needed to begin my career in tech.

## Project Highlight – Pitch Master (MERN Application)

Pitch Master is my ongoing MERN stack project.
It is a football analysis and comparison platform that allows users to:

- Create and compare custom Starting XIs.

- Analyze team strength based on selected players.

- View player profiles, basic stats, and comparisons.

- Save or review different team setups.

The project applies the full MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and demonstrates my ability to build structured, interactive, and data-driven applications. Pitch Master also reflects my interest in football and my ability to turn an idea into a functional technical solution.
